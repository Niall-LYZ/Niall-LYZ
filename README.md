# Hi there, I'm Niall-LYZ üëã

##  About Me
I‚Äôm a passionate DevSecOps & DevSecAI Engineer, dedicated to building secure, scalable, and automated pipelines that integrate AI-driven security into every stage of software delivery.

-  Leveraging modern DevSecOps practices to shift security left and embed it seamlessly into CI/CD workflows.
-  Integrating AI-powered tools‚Äîlike static analysis, alert prioritization, secrets detection, and threat modeling‚Äîto supercharge security‚Ä®automation.
-  Skilled in Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible), containers (Docker, Kubernetes), cloud platforms, and security tooling (SAST, SCA, Trivy, OWASP ZAP, etc.).
-  Advocate for DevSecAI: using machine learning, generative models, and intelligent agents to enhance efficiency and reduce security fatigue.

###  Tips for Personalizing Your README:
1. **Add badges** (e.g., build status, coverage, views) once your projects are live.
2. **Insert screenshots or GIFs** for visual impact.
3. **Keep descriptions brief but impactful**‚Äîhighlight the value you deliver and technologies you leverage.
4. **Link to any presentations, blog posts, or video demos** you‚Äôve created.
5. **Include contact links** if you're open to collaboration, consulting, or new opportunities.
